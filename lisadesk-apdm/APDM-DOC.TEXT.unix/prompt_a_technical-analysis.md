```
{ This UNIT contains the procedures that bring documents to the desktop and puts
  them back, locates, starts, and stops tools, and the dummy which manages all
  windows for which the tool code is not on-line. }
```

**Error Codes Reserved (Lines 8–9):**

```
{ The system error numbers in this module range from 800-899.
  The highest number in use is 898.  }

**🔐 CONST Block: Error and Status Codes**

Defined on **Lines 37–50**, these constants cover file, memory, and access errors used throughout the module:

```
CONST
       fNoErr      = 0;
       aborted     = 13;        { User clicked Cancel/op aborted   }
       fBadData    = 9;         { The doc's data is corrupted      }
       fBadPassword= 17;        { Password could not access all diskfiles }
       fCantAlter  = 16;        { The doc is so old the tool cant convert it }
       fCantRead   = 3;         { Unable to read the source diskfile }
       fCantWrite  = 4;         { Unable to write to dest diskfile }
       fCatalogErr = 5;         { Err accessing filer catalog      }
       fDirtyDoc   = 2;         { An edited doc can refuse to put back, etc. }
       fMustAlter  = 15;        { User wouldn't let tool convert old doc to new format }
       fNewerDoc   = 14;        { Doc is newer than tool           }
       fNoMemory   = 7;         { Insufficient memory space        }
       fNoSpace    = 6;         { Not enough room on disk          }
```

These constants signal:

•	Memory constraints

•	Disk read/write failures

•	Format incompatibility between old documents and newer tools

•	User-aborted or access-denied conditions

---

Continuing the analysis of the **Apple Lisa Document Manager (DmDoc)** Pascal unit, we now move through more key procedures dealing with file operations, tool path resolution, document resumption, event generation, and cleanup logic. These reflect the Lisa system’s robust file management and interprocess communication architecture.

---

**🔧 PROCEDURE: ResumeDocs**

```
PROCEDURE ResumeDocs (wPtr: WindowPtr);
```

> Developer Comment:
> 

```
{ This proc tries to find tools for docs on the desktop that need tools.
  It is called whenever a disk is removed (tools removed but docs may remain)
  or inserted (a source of new tools).  If wPtr is NIL then we attepmt to
  resume all docs otherwise only the doc indicated by wPtr.  }
```

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** ResumeDocs

•	**Input:** wPtr – pointer to a specific window/document. If NIL, all applicable documents are considered.

•	**Role:** Attempts to associate documents remaining on the desktop with their corresponding tools.

•	**Trigger Conditions:** Disk insertion/removal, which may affect the availability of tools.

•	**System Interaction:** Uses the window/document association model and possibly catalog/tool registries.

---

**🔧 PROCEDURE: RetToolPathname**

```
PROCEDURE RetToolPathname (VAR error: INTEGER; toolID: TtoolID;
                    devHdl: TentryHdl; VAR toolPathName: Pathname);
```

> Developer Comment:
> 

```
{ This proc builds a tool diskfile pathname, less extension e.g. 'obj', given
  the tools id and the device it is on.  }
```

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** RetToolPathname

•	**Inputs:**

•	toolID: Identifies the specific tool.

•	devHdl: Device handle for the storage volume.

•	**Output:**

•	toolPathName: Computed path name without file extension.

•	**System Role:** Supports dynamic loading or launching of tools by calculating their full path on disk.

---

**🔧 PROCEDURE: SendFilerEvent**

```
PROCEDURE SendFilerEvent (VAR err: INTEGER; proc: processID; folder: WindowPtr;
                          what: FilerOp; docName: Pathname; dfRefnum: INTEGER;
                          sourceName: Pathname; password: E_Name; VAR reply: FReason);
```

> Developer Comment:
> 

```
{ This proc creates an event record and sends it via SendEvent to the proc and
  folder indicated.  ThePrefix is ignored for some FilerOps.  The dfRefnum is
  used only with the fcDfClose op.  the sourceName is used (optionally) with fcCopy.
  The proc's reply is returned via 'reply'.  }
```

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** SendFilerEvent

•	**Inputs:**

•	proc: Target process to receive the event.

•	folder: UI folder/window the event is associated with.

•	what: Operation type (FilerOp) such as copy or close.

•	docName, sourceName: Primary and optional source pathnames.

•	dfRefnum: Disk file reference number, relevant for close operations.

•	password: Credential for secured operations.

•	**Output:** reply – response code from the receiving process.

•	**System Role:** Implements inter-process communication for file actions using structured event dispatch.

**🔧 FUNCTION: ShredContents**

```
FUNCTION ShredContents(volHdl: TentryHdl; objCatRID: TcatRID;
                       dontResize: BOOLEAN; cantAbort: BOOLEAN) : BOOLEAN;
```

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** ShredContents

•	**Inputs:**

•	volHdl, objCatRID: Identify the object to delete.

•	dontResize, cantAbort: Flags to control operation robustness.

•	**Returns:** Boolean indicating success.

•	**Purpose:** Recursively deletes a document’s contents (data and metadata) from disk.

•	**Distinction:** May preserve structural space if dontResize is set.

---

**🔧 FUNCTION: ShredObject**

```
FUNCTION ShredObject (volHdl: TentryHdl; objCatRID: TcatRID;
                      dontResize: BOOLEAN; cantAbort: BOOLEAN) : BOOLEAN;
```

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	Essentially identical in interface and semantics to ShredContents, likely targeting the entire document object, not just its contents.

---

**🔧 PROCEDURE: SonTerminated**

```
PROCEDURE SonTerminated;
```

> Developer Comment:
> 

```
{ This proc is called by the OS when an application terminates.  It cleans up
  the tool entry, suspends any docs open by the tool, attempts crash recovery
  if appropriate, and dismounts the tool's volume if the volume is marked for
  dismount and this is the last tool on it. }
```

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** SonTerminated

•	**Role:** Cleanup handler for tool (application) termination events.

•	**System Integration:**

•	Closes open documents

•	Initiates recovery if needed

•	Handles volume dismounting based on usage

•	**Legacy Significance:** Reveals robust lifecycle management between applications and the Lisa filesystem.

---

**🔧 PROCEDURE: StartDoc**

```
PROCEDURE StartDoc (docHdl: TentryHdl; resume: BOOLEAN);
```

> Developer Comment:
> 

```
{ This proc is used to start the tool behind the doc. It can be used both for
  newly opend docs and those previously opened but whose tool could not be
  run for whatever reason. If resume is true, messages }
```

*Note: Comment is truncated – the rest will be decoded in the next pass.*

**📌 Function Breakdown (Partial):**

•	**Name:** StartDoc

•	**Inputs:**

•	docHdl: Document handle.

•	resume: Indicates if the document is being resumed or opened fresh.

•	**Purpose:** Launches or resumes the associated tool for a given document.

---

---

**🔧 PROCEDURE: ZapPassword**

```
PROCEDURE ZapPassword (VAR fileName: Pathname);
```

> No developer comment or inline explanation.
> 

**📌 Function Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** ZapPassword

•	**Input:** fileName – a file whose password (likely protection or encryption state) is to be cleared or removed.

•	**Inferred Role:** Removes security access from a document, possibly during copy, recovery, or reinitialization.

**🔄 IMPLEMENTATION SECTION**

```
IMPLEMENTATION
```

This is the official marker for the start of executable implementation and declarations not exposed through the interface.

---

**💻 Compiler Directives and Build Conditions**

```
{$IFC FlrSymbols }
{$D+ }
{$ELSEC }
{$D- }
{$ENDC }

{$IFC FlrDebug }
{$R+ }
{$ELSEC }
{$R- }
{$ENDC }
```

•	**$D+, $D-**: Enables/disables debug information.

•	**$R+, $R-**: Enables/disables runtime range checking.

•	These are conditional depending on the presence of FlrSymbols or FlrDebug, supporting multiple build modes.

---

**🧱 Internal Constants**

```
CONST
  copyDsDfName  = '{!CopyBufr}';
  intLibName    = 'Intrinsic.lib';
  minDsSize     = 512;
```

These constants are used for:

•	Buffer names used during copy operations

•	The default name of the intrinsic code library

•	Minimum data segment size for disk I/O operations

**Tool Startup Error Codes:**

```
  noCode        = 1;  { No code file found }
  toolProtected = 2;  { Not executable on this machine }
  toolInvalid   = 3;  { Code file is bad/incomplete }
  toolTooBusy   = 4;  { Not enough memory }
  toolNeedsDisk = 5;  { Not enough disk space }
```

**OS Filesystem Layout:**

```
  entriesPerMapBlk = 119;   { OS keeps list of data blk ptrs ext to data blks }
  fixedOverhead    = 2;     { 1 hints and label, 1 map block }
```

•	**Insight:** Lisa’s filesystem stores metadata in dedicated map blocks with known overhead constants.

---

**🧬 TYPE DEFINITION: DocStates**

```
TYPE
  DocStates = SET OF TdocState;
```

**📌 Type Breakdown:**

•	**Name:** DocStates

•	**Structure:** Pascal set of TdocState values.

•	**Use:** Represents the collection of states a document may be in (e.g., open, dirty, resumable, locked).

---

**🔧 INTERNAL VARIABLES**

```
VAR
  blankStr:         NameString;
  containerSet:     KindSet;
  resumable:        DocStates;
  shellDfName:      E_Name;
  systemIntrinsics: Lf_List;

  waitList:         T_WaitList;   {*** O/S bug workaround ***}
  eventBlk:         r_eventBlk;   {*** ditto ***}
```

•	blankStr, containerSet: Likely default or scratch working values

•	resumable: Tracks document states eligible for resumption

•	systemIntrinsics: Tracks system-level intrinsic routines used by tools or file operations

•	waitList, eventBlk: Provide internal patches/workarounds for OS behavior.

---

**🔗 EXTERNAL PROCEDURE REFERENCES**

These are likely defined in system-level units or hardware abstraction layers:

```
PROCEDURE AnotherDiskette (VAR err: INTEGER; devHdl: TentryHdl; theOp: TuserOp; diskct: INTEGER;
                           seqNum: INTEGER; eraseDisk: BOOLEAN);              EXTERNAL;

PROCEDURE DismountVol (device: Tdevice; eject: BOOLEAN; resume: BOOLEAN);     EXTERNAL;

FUNCTION  GetNextDiskette (VAR err: INTEGER; devHdl, sVolHdl: TentryHdl;
                           VAR diskCt: INTEGER; xferOp: TuserOp) : BOOLEAN;   EXTERNAL;
```

•	These routines manage **removable media**, sequencing multi-disk operations, or handling dismount scenarios.

•	Their presence indicates Lisa’s **explicit support for multi-disk operations** — relevant in the floppy-disk-dominated 1983 environment.
