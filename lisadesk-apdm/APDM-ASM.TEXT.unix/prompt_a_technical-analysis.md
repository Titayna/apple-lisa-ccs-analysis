**Technical Software Analysis**

**File: APDM-ASM.TEXT.unix.txt**

**Context**: This file is a small assembly routine used within the Lisa dialog box subsystem. The code is written in Motorola 68000 assembly language, matching the Apple Lisa’s CPU architecture.

---

**Code Listing and Analysis**

```
;assembly language procedure to allow the dialog box code to execute
;a button procedure.  Call DoDiBtn(ProcPtr), where ProcPtr is the
;address of the procedure to execute when the associated dialog
;button is 'pushed'.
```

**Lines 1–4:**

**Comment Block (Preserve Verbatim)**

This block documents the purpose of the assembly routine:

•	It provides a callable function DoDiBtn.

•	This is designed to be used in the Lisa GUI dialog box system.

•	It takes a procedure pointer ProcPtr as a parameter.

•	When the dialog button is activated, the routine jumps to and executes the procedure at ProcPtr.

⚠ **Note**: Comments are preserved exactly as required, including capitalization and punctuation. No content is altered.

```
     .SEG "flrAtt"            ; SAME SEG AS THE REST OF THE DIALOG BOX CODE
```

**Line 6:**

**Assembler Directive**:

•	.SEG "flrAtt" specifies the segment in which this code resides.

•	The segment name "flrAtt" appears to be associated with the dialog box logic, suggesting organization by UI module.

**Comment**:

•	Indicates this segment is shared with the rest of the dialog box code, keeping this routine colocated with related procedures.

---

```
     .PROC DoDiBtn, 4
```

**Line 7:**

**Procedure Declaration**:

•	Declares a new procedure named DoDiBtn.

•	The second argument 4 indicates the number of bytes of parameters or stack usage expected — in this case, a single 4-byte pointer.

```
     MOVE.L    (SP)+,A0       ; GET THE RETURN ADDRESS
     MOVE.L    (SP)+,A1       ; GET THE PROC POINTER PARAM (ADDRESS OF THE PROCEDURE TO CALL)
     MOVE.L    A0,-(SP)       ; PUSH THE RETURN ADDRESS BACK ON THE STACK
     JMP       (A1)           ; JUMP TO THE PROCEDURE
```

**Lines 8–11:**

**Instruction Breakdown**:

**Line 8:**

```
MOVE.L    (SP)+,A0       ; GET THE RETURN ADDRESS
```

•	Pops the return address (saved by the caller) from the stack into register A0.

**Line 9:**

```
MOVE.L    (SP)+,A1       ; GET THE PROC POINTER PARAM (ADDRESS OF THE PROCEDURE TO CALL)
```

•	Pops the procedure pointer argument ProcPtr into register A1.

**Line 10:**

```
MOVE.L    A0,-(SP)       ; PUSH THE RETURN ADDRESS BACK ON THE STACK
```

•	Pushes the original return address back on the stack to maintain proper return behavior once the called procedure completes.

**Line 11:**

```
JMP       (A1)           ; JUMP TO THE PROCEDURE
```

•	Unconditionally jumps to the address in A1, executing the procedure passed as a parameter.

---

```
     .END
```

**Line 12:**

**Assembler Directive**:

•	Marks the end of the procedure declaration for DoDiBtn.

---

**Function Breakdown: DoDiBtn**

•	**Name**: DoDiBtn

•	**Role**:

Dynamically calls a procedure in response to a GUI dialog box button press. It enables procedural linkage between GUI elements and application behavior.

•	**Behavior**:

•	Accepts a pointer to a function (Pascal-style).

•	Pops stack values to rearrange for dynamic jump execution.

•	Restores the return address to enable the called function to return control properly.

•	**Key Instructions**: MOVE.L, JMP

•	**System Calls / Interactions**: None directly, but facilitates UI-to-procedure execution path.

**Summary and Historical Insight**

This snippet is a **low-level trampoline routine** allowing the Apple Lisa dialog system, written in Pascal, to execute arbitrary procedures when GUI buttons are triggered. Rather than hardwiring function calls, the Lisa OS uses procedure pointers — a forward-looking design pattern that supports modularity and GUI event handling.

•	**Language**: Motorola 68000 Assembly

•	**Design Pattern**: Callback procedure dispatch

•	**Architectural Insight**:

•	Early use of event-driven UI patterns.

•	Stack manipulation to simulate dynamic procedure calling within a structured GUI framework.

•	Reflects the need to bridge Pascal and assembly during early GUI system development.
