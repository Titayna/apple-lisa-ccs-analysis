**🧠 Technical Software Analysis – Apple Lisa (1983)**

**Component Analyzed**: APDM-ALERT.TEXT.unix.txt

**Component Type**: User Interface Alert Message Constants

**Language**: Assembly-annotated string resource definitions

**Domain**: Lisa Office System – User Interaction & Error Messaging

---

**📘 Overview**

This file defines the **alert messages, prompts, labels, and constants** for the Apple Lisa user interface (UI). These alerts were used to display system errors, user guidance, and interaction dialogs through Lisa’s early GUI system. It is not executable code but a resource file of **localizable string constants**—historically critical to understanding user experience and system behavior in Lisa.

Messages include:

•	Alert types (note, stop, ask, wait)

•	Structured error/instruction dialogs with placeholders (e.g., ^1, ^2)

•	System error diagnostics

•	Locale/time/date format rules

•	Icon titles, labels, attributes, and menu definitions

These messages were likely loaded by **Desktop Manager** or **APDM (Apple Desktop Manager)** modules at runtime.

**🔍 Structure and Content Analysis**

**📁 Resource Message Structure**

Each block follows this form:

```
<message_id> <alert_type> [modifiers]
<text body>
^!<button1>^?<button2>
; <developer comment>
```

**Fields:**

•	message_id: Integer ID, used by code to fetch message.

•	alert_type: Indicates UI behavior (e.g., modal, non-blocking).

•	text body: Message with control codes like ^L^L (line breaks), and parameter placeholders ^1, ^N, etc.

•	; comment: Developer explanations; **must be preserved exactly**.

**📑 Detailed Technical Pass**

**📌 Lines 1–5**

```
?
Wait
Stop
Note
Caution
Cancel
OK
```

Basic vocabulary tokens for message composition. Not tied to numbered IDs but foundational to building prompts or alerts.

---

**📌 Lines 6–8**

```
;
;            Copyright 1983, 1984 Apple Computer, Inc.
;
```

Standard legal declaration, historically timestamps this module’s development to Lisa OS 1.0–1.2 era.

---

**📌 Lines 10–15**

**Message ID**: 1

**Type**: note alert

```
The Desktop Manager could not find the message that should appear here.  If you
are unable to proceed, contact a qualified service representative, and mention
the number ^N.
```

•	Used as a **fallback message** when no valid alert is found.

•	^N: placeholder for error ID.

**Comment**: *Not given but this is likely a default catch-all fallback in message loading logic.*

---

**📌 Lines 17–23**

**Message ID**: 2

**Type**: stop alert

```
The Lisa is having technical difficulties accessing the startup disk.^L^L
Put away your documents one at a time or push the on-off button to save them all.
^L^L
If the problem recurs, refer to the Lisa Office System manual, Appendix A, Office System Error Messages,
under Difficulty Accessing Disk.
```

•	Critical system-level error.

•	Multiline message using ^L^L as a line spacer.

•	Diagnostics route through documentation.

---

**📌 Lines 25–26**

**Message ID**: 3

**Type**: stop alert=1

Internal assignment or category grouping alert 3 with level 1 stop alert severity.

---

**📌 Lines 28–29**

**Message ID**: 4

**Type**: wait alert=1

“Wait” alert with level 1 — possibly used for long operations where disk I/O is ongoing.

---

**📌 Lines 31–47**

**Message ID**: 10

**Function**: Time Format Definition

**Comment Block**:

```
; The syntax for the time format string is:
;
;    leadingTimeString/separatorTimeString/trailing24HourTimeString/amString/pmString/12or24HourSwitch
```

**Description**:

•	String syntax defines **localizable time format** for different locales.

•	Use of slash (/) as **field separator**.

•	Optional fields allow Lisa to dynamically adapt to 12/24-hour clocks.

**Example format stored**:

```
/://am/pm/12
```

Parsed as:

•	No leading

•	: separator

•	No trailing 24-hour suffix

•	AM/PM strings

•	12-hour mode

---

**📌 Lines 49–87**

**Message ID**: 11

**Function**: Date Format Rules

```
; The date format alert defines date order, showing of leading zeroes, and the date separator.
```

**Format Syntax**:

```
dateOrderString_showZero_dateSeparator
```

•	dateOrderString: e.g., mdy, DMY

•	showZero: 0, O, y = yes; space or n, N = no

•	dateSeparator: any character

**Table of Real World Configurations:**

```
US       => /://am/pm/12         mdy0/                => 12/31/83
UK       => /.//am/pm/12         DMY .                => 31.12.83
France   => /H ////24            dmy .                => 31.12.83
Germany  => /:/UHR///24          dmy0.                => 31.12.83
```

System falls back to US format on **syntax error**.

---

**📌 Line 89**

```
mdy0/
```

•	Default fallback for US-style date: month-day-year with leading zeros, slash-separated.

---

**📌 Lines 91–4300+**

**Block Content**:

•	Alert messages indexed 50 to 159

•	Additional internal strings: constants 700–1013

•	System labels: Diskette, Clipboard, Tool, LisaWrite, LisaCalc…

•	Menu definitions and diagnostic/dev/debug tools.

---

**🧱 Historical and Architectural Notes**

•	The use of numbered message IDs and parameter placeholders like ^1, ^2 suggests **formatted runtime substitution**.

•	Developer comments are concise but **directly map** to GUI operations like file movement, duplication, clipboard, pad creation.

•	Alert types are distinguished for **UI modality control** — e.g., stop, wait, ask, note, silent.

•	String constants imply early support for **localization** and **internationalization** (unusual for 1983).

---

**📌 Conclusions**

This file serves as the **localized message definition repository** for the Lisa Office System’s GUI alerts. It is a core piece of the Apple Desktop Manager (APDM) subsystem, critical to delivering dynamic user interaction and diagnostics in a highly structured and adaptable way. The modular string format, combined with developer commentary, provides a deeply informative look at:

•	Early GUI logic and feedback systems

•	Structured error handling

•	Internationalization practices in early GUI systems

•	Developer usability tooling via labeled alerts
