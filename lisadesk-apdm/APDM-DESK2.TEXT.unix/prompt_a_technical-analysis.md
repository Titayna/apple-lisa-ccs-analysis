**Apple Lisa Source – Desk Manager / Desktop Subsystem**

---

**File Header**

```
{ ApDm/Desk2 - Copyright 1983, 1984, Apple Computer Inc. }
```

•	Historical metadata comment indicating this is part of the “ApDm” (Apple Desktop Manager?) code module, second desk file.

•	Copyright attributed to Apple.

---

```
{$S flrAll }
```

•	**Compiler Directive**: Sectioning compiler directive ($S) for Pascal indicating this procedure belongs to the flrAll segment, likely related to file or folder routing.

---

**Function Analysis**

---

**Lines 4–41: MakeObjActive**

```
PROCEDURE MakeObjActive{* obj: ObjectHandle *};
```

**Description**

•	**Purpose**: Makes the given object active within the UI system.

•	Handles activation depending on the ownership of the window — whether local or owned by another process.

•	Differentiates between normal handshake (MakeFldrActive) and an optimized IPC shortcut (WmStartDoc).

---

**Developer Comment (Lines 6–8)**

```
{ Causes a new object to be made active.  If the objects window is owned by
  another process then we do the fast activate protocol, "WMStartDoc", otherwise
  we go through the normal handshake protocol, "MakeFldrActive."  }
```

•	**Key insight**: System distinguishes inter-process UI ownership and uses different activation strategies.

•	**Terms**:

•	WmStartDoc: Fast interprocess activation call.

•	MakeFldrActive: Standard window activation handshake.

•	Suggests internal window manager protocol handling.

---

**Variable Declarations (Lines 10–12)**

```
VAR err: INTEGER;
    newProcess: BOOLEAN;
    window: WindowPtr;
```

•	Local variables:

•	err: Likely used for error codes (not referenced here).

•	newProcess: Flag for process context switching (not referenced directly in this segment).

•	window: Pointer to the associated window of the object.

---

**Tracing & Logging (Line 14)**

```
{$IFC flrDebug } IF trcCalls THEN ALogCall; {$ENDC};
IF trcFiler THEN WRITELN('MakeObjActive',WriteName(obj));
```

•	Debugging code conditionally compiled:

•	Logs calls using ALogCall.

•	Outputs the name of the object via WriteName(obj).

---

**Object Window Extraction & Early Exit (Lines 15–18)**

```
window := obj^^.objWindow;
IF (obj^^.objWindow = keyWindow) OR   { active or to become active }
   (obj = nilObject) OR
   (window = NIL) THEN EXIT(MakeObjActive);
```

•	Checks:

•	If the object is already active.

•	If it is nilObject (likely a special sentinel).

•	If no valid window pointer exists.

•	If any condition is true, exit early.

---

**Developer Comment (Lines 20–23)**

```
{ Flush all typeahead.  This is done because there may be typeahead already
  classified incorrectly.  Note: This is a window manager/Desk architecture
  problem which should be fixed someday. }
```

•	Suggests a known architectural issue with typeahead classification during window activation.

•	Flushes keyboard buffer as a workaround.

---

**Input Buffer Flush (Line 25)**

```
FlushTypeAhead(FALSE);
```

•	**System call**: Clears any queued user input — ensures interaction starts cleanly post-activation.

---

**Remote Process Window Activation Branch (Lines 27–34)**

```
IF (obj^^.kind IN docToolSet)          { a doc or tool window }
AND NOT MyWindow(window)               { that belongs to another process }
AND NOT (obj^^.setAside) THEN          { that just started up }
   BEGIN
   DeactObject(TRUE,TRUE);             { pretend I received a deactivate  }
   AdjustDesktopMenu;
   ClearMenuBar;                       { app won't do a TakeControl }
   WmStartDoc(window);                 { special activate, does it now }
   END
```

•	Activation logic for a **remote process-owned window**:

•	Check object type: must be in docToolSet (likely a set of document/tool window types).

•	Check ownership: not handled by current process.

•	Ensure it’s not set aside (in startup transition).

•	Executes:

•	Simulated deactivation (DeactObject) to force clean state.

•	Adjusts menu system and clears UI menu bar.

•	Calls WmStartDoc, a specialized remote window activation routine.

---

**Default Fallback: Local Activation (Lines 36–37)**

```
ELSE
   MakeFldrActive(window,whyNot);
```

•	If not a remote process, use the standard activation function MakeFldrActive.

---

**Function End (Line 38)**

```
END;
```

**Lines 42–61: MakeObject**

```
FUNCTION MakeObject{* father:      ObjectHandle;
                      name:        FmaxStr;
                      whatKind:    ObjectKind;
                      whatTool:    LongInt;

                      diskSplit:   BOOLEAN;
                      accessCtrl:  BOOLEAN): ObjectHandle *};
```

---

**Description**

•	**Function Role**: Creates and initializes a new desktop object (file, folder, app, etc.) and links it into a parent object (father)’s contents list.

•	**Behavior**:

•	Allocates object memory.

•	Optionally initializes a head/tail list node if the parent is empty.

•	Returns a pointer to the newly created object (ObjectHandle).

•	**Does Not Draw the Object**: No visual update is performed — creation is purely data structure-based.

---

**Developer Comments (Lines 23–24)**

```
{ Allocate a new object and insert at the head of contents. }
{ Does not draw it }
```

•	Clarifies operational scope: structural modification only, not UI.

•	Object is inserted at the **head** of the contents list (prepending logic).

---

**Parameter Overview**

•	father: Parent object handle (container).

•	name: Filename or object label.

•	whatKind: Type of object (e.g., file, folder).

•	whatTool: Associated tool or application ID.

•	where: On-screen location (Point).

•	windRect: Window rectangle bounds (Rect).

•	newState: Initial state (e.g., active/inactive, iconified).

•	whatView: View type (icon, list, etc.).

•	whichVol: Volume handle (possibly for file system volume).

•	recId: Catalog record ID.

•	createTime, modTime: Time metadata (creation and last modified).

•	diskSize: Allocated disk space.

•	diskSplit: Whether data is split across volumes.

•	accessCtrl: Permissions/access control flag.

---

**Local Variables (Lines 26–28)**

```
VAR thisObject: ObjectHandle;
    listHead: ObjectHandle;
    aNameHdl: FmaxStrHdl;
```

•	thisObject: Handle to the new object being created.

•	listHead: Potential head of contents list (used later).

•	aNameHdl: Handle for the object’s name string.

---

**Debug Logging (Lines 29–31)**

```
{$IFC flrDebug } IF trcCalls THEN ALogCall; {$ENDC};
IF trcFiler THEN WRITELN('MakeObject');
IF dbgFiler THEN WRITELN('   making object: kind is ',ORD(whatKind):1);
```

•	Standard tracing outputs:

•	Call trace (ALogCall)

•	Function entry print (MakeObject)

•	Object type ordinal value print (ORD(whatKind))

---

**Initialization (Line 32)**

```
MakeObject := NIL;
```

•	Defaults the return value to NIL in case of failure.

•	Ensures memory allocation failures or preconditions won’t return invalid objects.

---

**Developer Comment (Line 34)**

```
{ allocate a head/tail node if necessary }
```

•	Describes conditional logic for initializing the parent’s contents list if empty.

---

**Head/Tail Node Allocation (Lines 36–39)**

```
IF father^^.contents = nilObject THEN   { add head/tail node if empty list }
   BEGIN
   thisObject := NewObjList(father);
   IF thisObject = NIL THEN EXIT(MakeObject);    { out of heap space }
   father^^.contents := thisObject;
   END;
```

•	Checks if the parent has an empty content list.

•	Calls NewObjList(father) to create a list container node.

•	Fails early if out of memory (thisObject = NIL).

•	Otherwise, sets the parent’s contents pointer.

---

**Developer Comment (Line 41)**

```
{ allocate the new object }
```

•	Indicates transition to the actual object creation portion.

---

**Finalization of MakeObject Function (Lines 102–111)**

---

```
   modified    := modTime;
   size        := diskSize;
   viewMode    := whatView;
   windowRect  := windRect;
   freeSpace   := 0;
   backedup    := 0;
   SetRect(nameRect,0,0,0,0);     { gets set by DrawName }
```

**Remaining Field Initialization**

•	modified: Sets modification timestamp.

•	size: Stores file size (used for disk display or quota tracking).

•	viewMode: Set again redundantly — may reflect a safeguard against compiler/register loss.

•	windowRect: Stores window position and dimensions.

•	freeSpace: Initialized to 0 — possibly dynamic later.

•	backedup: Backup timestamp or version indicator, starts at 0.

•	nameRect: UI-related field; set to zeroed-out rectangle. Will be set later by DrawName.

**Developer Comment (Line 109)**

```
{ gets set by DrawName }
```

•	Indicates nameRect is calculated on-demand during UI render.

---

```
   END;
MakeObject := thisObject;
END;
```

•	**Block End**: Closes the WITH block.

•	**Return**: Sets the function result to the newly created object handle.

---

**Next Function Begins**

---

**Line 115: Section Directive**

```
{$S flrCold }
```

•	Places the next procedure into the flrCold segment — likely low-priority or rarely called code, possibly to optimize hot/cold code locality.

---

**Lines 116–161: MakePadContents**

```
PROCEDURE MakePadContents{* obj: ObjectHandle; whichState: ObjectState *};
```

**Description**

•	Converts selected documents/folders into **pads**, a visual metaphor used in Lisa’s UI (folders as pads of paper).

•	Triggers redrawing of objects.

•	Contains fail-safe: returns FALSE if a document resists shutdown or if the user cancels.

---

**Developer Comment (Lines 118–119)**

```
{ Change selected documents/folders into a pads and redraw.  Returns FALSE if a
  document refuses to shut down or if user aborts. }
```

•	Explicitly warns about two possible failure modes:

1.	System-level refusal (e.g., file busy).

2.	User-aborted interaction.

---

**LABEL Usage (Line 121)**

```
LABEL 34;
```

•	Pascal LABEL keyword: defines a jump label (used with GOTO) for early exits or recovery paths — archaic but seen in Apple Lisa code for control flow simplification.

---

**Variable Declarations (Line 122)**

```
VAR son,listHead: ObjectHandle;
```

•	son: likely refers to child object in the container.

•	listHead: reference to beginning of object list (same use as in MakeObject).

---

**Nested Function: FoundTool (Lines 125–161)**

```
FUNCTION FoundTool(pToolRec: PtrCatRec; pFsInfo: PtrFs_Info): BOOLEAN;
```

**Purpose**

•	Callback invoked by a tool-check routine (ToolCheck).

•	Handles the case where a tool (i.e., application) is found inside a folder — which is disallowed for “pad” conversions.

---

**Developer Comment (Lines 127–128)**

```
{ Gets called by "ToolCheck" when a tool is found.  Tells user that a folder
  pad cannot contain tools }
```

•	Important architectural rule:

•	Folders being converted to pads **must not contain tools**.

•	Tools require process associations and cannot live inside visual pads.

---

**Local Variables (Lines 130–131)**

```
VAR catRID: TcatRID;
    name: FmaxStr;
```

•	catRID: Represents a catalog record ID (likely to resolve name from volume).

•	name: Temporary string buffer for titles.

---

**Logic (Lines 132–139)**

```
FoundTool := TRUE;
GetObjTitle(son,TRUE,name);
ArgAlert(1,name);                     { folder name }
catRID.fatherID := pToolRec^.parentID;
catRID.uniqueID := pToolRec^.selfId;
GetObjName(son^^.volHdl,catRID,name);
ArgAlert(2,name);                     { tool name }
StopAlert(flrAlert,134);             { folder has tools ... }
```

•	Always returns TRUE — indicates a problem/tool found.

•	Uses GetObjTitle and GetObjName to retrieve object names.

•	Issues alerts (ArgAlert) with:

1.	The name of the folder.

2.	The name of the tool.

•	StopAlert(flrAlert,134) shows a modal message: "folder has tools ...", blocking the operation.

---

**Continuation of MakePadContents Procedure (Lines 162–200)**

---

**End of FoundTool Function**

```
END;
```

•	Closes the nested FoundTool function.

---

**Begin Main Procedure Block**

```
BEGIN
{$IFC flrDebug } IF trcCalls THEN ALogCall; {$ENDC};
IF trcFiler THEN WRITELN('MakePadContents',WriteName(obj));
```

•	Begins the main body of MakePadContents.

•	Conditional logging:

•	ALogCall: logs the call for tracing.

•	WriteName(obj): outputs the object’s name.

---

**Line 169**

```
AutoScroll(obj,hilited);  { make the selection visible }
```

•	**Call to AutoScroll**:

•	Ensures the selected object is brought into view.

•	**Comment** confirms this is a visual/UI-related action.

---

**List Initialization (Lines 171–172)**

```
listHead := obj^^.contents;
son := listHead^^.prev;
```

•	Initializes pointers to iterate over child objects:

•	listHead: beginning of doubly-linked list.

•	son: the last actual item in the circular list (using prev).

---

**Iteration Over Children (Lines 174–198)**

```
WHILE son <> listHead DO
   BEGIN
```

•	Iterates backwards through the contents list until reaching the head again.

---

**Early Exit: User Abort (Line 176)**

```
IF UserAbort THEN Exit(MakePadContents);
```

•	User-triggered escape — stops processing safely.

---

**Object Matching State (Line 177)**

```
IF son^^.state = whichState THEN
```

•	Checks if this child is in the matching state (selected/highlighted/etc.).

---

**Check: Password Protected (Lines 178–181)**

```
IF son^^.passworded THEN
   BEGIN
   ArgAlert(1,son^^.nameHdl^^);
   StopAlert(flrAlert,157);
   END
```

•	If passworded, display an alert and block processing of this object.

---

**Check: Split Across Disks (Lines 182–185)**

```
ELSE IF son^^.split THEN
   BEGIN
   ArgAlert(1,son^^.nameHdl^^);
   StopAlert(flrAlert,150);
   END
```

•	If object spans multiple disks, warn and disallow pad conversion.

---

**Else Clause: Eligible Object (Line 186)**

```
ELSE
   BEGIN
```

---

**Check: Large Object Warning (Lines 187–190)**

```
IF son^^.size > 300 THEN
   BEGIN
   ArgAlert(1,son^^.nameHdl^^);
   IF AskAlert(flrAlert,360) = 1 THEN GOTO 34;   { skip this large object }
   END;
```

•	Warns about large object size.

•	AskAlert presents a confirmation dialog; if declined, jumps to LABEL 34 to skip the object.

---

**Mark as Dirty (Line 192)**

```
son^^.dirty := TRUE;
```

•	Flags the object as “dirty” — requiring UI redraw or state update.

---

**Check for Folder or Letter Kind (Lines 194–197)**

```
IF (son^^.kind = folderKind) OR (son^^.kind = letterKind) THEN
   BEGIN
   IF ToolCheck(son^^.volHdl,son^^.catRID,FoundTool) THEN
      EXIT(MakePadContents);
```

•	If object is a **folder or letter**, run a tool check using the earlier-defined FoundTool.

•	If a tool is found inside, ToolCheck returns true → aborts operation.

---

The procedure likely continues with additional transformation or iteration logic. I’ll now continue parsing to complete MakePadContents.

**Finalization of MakePadContents Procedure (Lines 202–229)**

---

**Kind Conversion Logic (Lines 202–205)**

```
IF son^^.kind = folderKind THEN
   son^^.kind := folderPad
ELSE
   son^^.kind := letterPad;
```

•	Converts **folderKind** to **folderPad**

•	Converts **letterKind** to **letterPad**

•	This updates the object’s kind to reflect its new pad-like visual or behavioral state.

---

**Document Conversion (Lines 206–210)**

```
ELSE IF son^^.kind = docKind THEN
   BEGIN
   IF LiveObject(son) THEN    { shut down doc first }
      IF NOT StopDoc(son,FALSE,FALSE) THEN EXIT(MakePadContents);
   son^^.kind := docPad;
   END;
```

•	For documents (docKind):

•	Checks if the object is “live” (i.e., active or open).

•	Calls StopDoc to shut it down.

•	If shutdown fails (e.g., unsaved data), aborts the pad transformation.

•	If successful, updates kind to docPad.

---

**Catalog Update (Line 212)**

```
FlushObject(son);   { update the catalog }
```

•	Persists changes (e.g., type, state) to disk catalog.

•	Ensures consistency between UI state and filesystem.

---

**UI Redraw Logic (Lines 214–217)**

```
IF obj^^.viewMode = spatialView THEN
   ValidIcon(son,FALSE)   { schedule update to draw pad image }
ELSE
   DrawObject(son);       { draw pad image }
```

•	Chooses drawing method based on view mode:

•	If in spatialView, defers drawing by marking icon valid for redraw.

•	Otherwise, performs immediate redraw.

---

**End of Iteration Block (Lines 218–220)**

```
END;
34:
son := son^^.prev;
END;
```

•	Closes ELSE block and continues iteration.

•	LABEL 34 target reached via GOTO earlier for skipping large files.

---

**Procedure End (Line 222)**

```
END;
```

•	Full pad transformation loop complete.

---

**Next Function Begins**

---

**Section Directive (Line 226)**

```
{$S flrMisc }
```

•	Places this function into the flrMisc segment — for miscellaneous support functions.

---

**Lines 227–240: Match**

```
FUNCTION Match{* target: ObjectHandle; srcSet: KindSet; srcCount: INTEGER): BOOLEAN *};
```

**Description**

•	Evaluates whether the target object can be **highlighted as a valid drop target** during a drag-and-drop operation.

•	Used for UI interaction feedback.

---

**Developer Comment (Line 228)**

```
{ returns true if OK to hilite target during dragging of an icon }
```

•	Indicates function is strictly for visual feedback validation.

---

**Function Header Logic (Lines 229–235)**

```
BEGIN
{$IFC flrDebug } IF trcCalls THEN ALogCall; {$ENDC};
IF trcFiler THEN WRITELN('Match',WriteName(target));

Match := FALSE;
```

•	Initializes result to FALSE.

•	Tracing logs the call and prints the name of the potential target object.

---

**Transfer Legality Check (Line 237)**

```
{ first check that this transfer is legal for each selected object }
IF NOT (srcSet <= matchTable[target^^.kind]) THEN EXIT(Match);
```

•	Validates drag source types (srcSet) against a compatibility table indexed by the target’s kind.

•	matchTable likely maps legal drop operations.

•	If illegal, exits early with FALSE.

---

I’ll continue now with the remainder of the Match function and the next logical block.

**Continuation of MenuCommand – filingMenu Items (Lines 321–348)**

---

**mDuplicate (Line 321)**

```
DupContents(activeObject,hilited);
```

•	Duplicates the contents of activeObject, limited to hilited (selected) children.

---

**mAttributes (Lines 323–335)**

```
BEGIN
count := 0;
listHead := activeObject^^.contents;
son := listHead^^.prev;
WHILE son <> listHead DO
   BEGIN
   IF son^^.state = hilited THEN
      BEGIN
      ShowAttributes(son);
      count := count + 1;
      END;
   son := son^^.prev;
   END;
IF count = 0 THEN ShowAttributes(activeObject);
END;
```

•	Iterates through the contents of activeObject.

•	If any selected items (hilited) are found:

•	Calls ShowAttributes on them.

•	Tracks count to determine if fallback is needed.

•	If **none are selected**, shows attributes for activeObject itself.

---

**mNew (Line 337)**

```
TearOffContents(activeObject,hilited);
```

•	Likely implements a “tear-off” UI feature — separates selected content into a new window.

---

**mMakePad (Line 339)**

```
MakePadContents(activeObject,hilited);
```

•	Reuses earlier-defined procedure to convert contents to **pad objects**.

---

**mPrintStatus (Line 341)**

```
PrBgdDlg;
```

•	Prints or displays background dialog status — repeated option from scrapMenu.

---

**Close filingMenu Item CASE (Line 343)**

```
END;  { case item }
```

---

**Handling: editMenu (Lines 345–346)**

```
editMenu:
   EditCommands(item);
```

•	Simple call to EditCommands with the selected item.

•	Abstracts all edit-related menu options (e.g., Cut, Copy, Paste).

---

**Handling: housekeepingMenu (Lines 349–351)**

```
housekeepingMenu:
   CASE item OF
```

•	New CASE block under a system-related or disk maintenance menu.

---

**mEject (Lines 352–353)**

```
mEject:
   BEGIN      { try to eject even if we don't think that anything is there }
```

•	Begins an eject operation.

•	Comment highlights robustness: attempt ejection even when no disk appears mounted — failsafe design.

---

**Ejection Call (Line 354)**

```
IF UnmountAVolume(lTwigHdl^^.device,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,131) THEN;
```

•	Calls UnmountAVolume with flags:

•	lTwigHdl^^.device: the device ID from a global handle.

•	Several TRUE/FALSE flags — likely confirmation, force, etc.

•	131: Error or message code.

**mTrcAll**

```
mTrcAll:
   BEGIN
   eventDebug  := TRUE;
   trcFEntry   := TRUE;
   trcCatalog  := TRUE;

   trcAttribute:= TRUE;
   TraceDB(TRUE);

   (*
   {$IFC FLDDEBUG }
   SetFldTest(TRUE);
   {$ENDC }
   *)
   END;
```

•	**Description**:

•	Enables **all debug and trace flags** across the system.

•	TraceDB(TRUE) activates tracing at a global or database level.

•	SetFldTest(TRUE) (conditional) enables folder-specific debug test logic, if compiled.

•	Activates visibility into virtually every subsystem: file entries, catalogs, documents, volumes, dialogs, attributes.

---

**mTrcOff**

```
mTrcOff:
   BEGIN
   eventDebug  := FALSE;
   trcFEntry   := FALSE;
   trcCatalog  := FALSE;
   trcFDocCtrl := FALSE;
   trcFVolCtrl := FALSE;

   trcAttribute:= FALSE;
   TraceDB(FALSE);

   {$IFC FLDDEBUG }
   SetFldTest(FALSE);
   {$ENDC }
   END;
```

•	**Description**:

•	Disables all tracing and debug logging.

•	Ensures a silent or production-mode execution.

•	Cleanly shuts down optional debug segments via conditional compiler flags.

---

**Individual Debug Toggles**

```
mTrcEvents:   eventDebug  := NOT eventDebug;
mTrcFEntry:   trcFEntry   := NOT trcFEntry;
mTrcCatalog:  trcCatalog  := NOT trcCatalog;
mTrcFDocCtrl: trcFDocCtrl := NOT trcFDocCtrl;

mTrcFiler:    trcFiler    := NOT trcFiler;
mTrcDialog:   trcDialog   := NOT trcDialog;
mTrcAttribute:trcAttribute:= NOT trcAttribute;
```

•	Each menu item toggles its associated flag.

•	Allows selective tracing for targeted diagnostics.

•	Follows a common pattern: flag := NOT flag;

---

**mPrintDocs and mPrintVols**

```
mPrintDocs:
   PrintEntry(doc,NIL);
mPrintVols:
   PrintEntry(vol,NIL);
```

•	**Description**:

•	PrintEntry(doc, NIL) and PrintEntry(vol, NIL) print current document or volume records.

•	Likely used in diagnostics to inspect in-memory structures.

---

---

**Continuation of MenuCommand – specialMenu Items (Lines 442–471)**

---

**mPrintTools and mPrintDevs**

```
mPrintTools:
   PrintEntry(tool,NIL);
mPrintDevs:
   PrintEntry(dev,NIL);
```

•	Diagnostic routines that print internal representations of:

•	Tools (tool)

•	Devices (dev)
