**📁 UNIT: DmEntry**

📅 Date: 26-Oct-83

© Apple Computer Inc., 1983–1984

📄 File: ApDm/Entry.text

**📌 Module Purpose**

> Lines 5–12:
> 

```
{ This UNIT manages entry creation, storage, and retrieval.  An entry might
  describe a document, a tool, or a volume (disk). Because of the clumsiness
  of circumventing the type constraints, separate but identical interfaces are
  provided for each type of entry. Other special purpose operations are
  provided for each type of entry as required.

  Non-user-sensible entries are also maintained for tool names and devices.

  Storage is allocated from the heap. Each entry is stored as an individual
  unit and the entries linked together.  }
```

This unit implements an object entry management subsystem for Lisa, handling documents (doc), tools (tool), volumes (vol), and devices (dev). Entries are dynamically allocated, managed, and accessed via linked structures.

**🔢 Error Range**

> Lines 14–15:
> 

```
{ The system error number range for this module is 200-299.
  The highest number used is 205.  }
```

**➤ Errors Reserved**

•	200–299 (only up to 205 is currently used)

---

**🧩 INTERFACE SECTION**

---

**📚 Module Imports**

> Lines 17–32:
> 

```
USES
     {$U LibOS/SysCall  } SysCall,
     {$U LibOS/PSysCall } PSysCall,
     ...
     {$U FilerComm} FilerComm;
```

**Dependencies:**

•	System calls (SysCall, PSysCall)

•	UI elements (QuickDraw, FontMgr, Events, Menus, AlertMgr)

•	Device and process management (PmDecl, PMM)

•	File system communication (FilerComm)

•	Debug tracing (tracecalls, conditionally compiled)

---

**🏗️ Type Definitions**

**Lines 35–42 — Pointer & Machine Identification:**

```
TentryHdl = ^TentryPtr;
TMachine = (Lisa1, Pepsi);
```

•	TentryHdl: Handle to a pointer to an entry

•	TMachine: Lisa hardware variants

**Lines 43–60 — Device and State Enums**

**TDevice:**

•	Alias for CD_Position, device identifier

**TdevState: Represents device lifecycle states:**

```
(devEmpty, devMounting, devOnline, devDismounting, devBackingup, devTempDest)
```

**TdocState: Tracks document lifecycle:**

```
(blank, badTool, deadDoc, docReqd, mustAlter, noDisk, noTool, noToolDisk,
 opened, protectedTool, subProc, toolCrashed, tooBusy, tooNew, tooOld,
 toolOpened, closingFolder, closing)
```

**TtoolState: Execution state of tools:**

```
(sBadCode, sIniting, sNoCode, sRunning, sTerminating)
```

**TvolState: Volume lifecycle:**

```
(sNoDisk, sMounting, sMacDisk, sBadCatalog, sOldCatalog, sNoCatalog,
 sNoFileSystem, sMounted, sDismounting, sEjecting)
```

---

**📦 Entry Record and Variants**

**Lines 70–107:**

```
Tentry = (doc, tool, vol, dev);
TentryPtr = ^TentryRec;
```

**➤ TentryRec: Core structure for all entries.**

Each record contains:

•	nextHdl: Next entry in the linked list

•	nameHdl: Entry name

•	volHdl: Volume association (NIL for volume entries)

•	A union (CASE kind: Tentry OF) that defines the type-specific structure:

•	doc: Catalog ID, password, window, linked tool, tool ID, doc state

•	tool: Catalog ID, open doc count, tool ID, process ID, tool state

•	vol: Device handle, catalog flags, scan ID, file system version, etc.

•	dev: Physical device specs, UI identifiers, user-friendly name, removable flag

---

**🧾 Field Access Structure**

**Lines 109–136:**

```
TentryField = ...;
TfieldVar = RECORD ...
```

•	Enumerates all field types within an entry (TentryField)

•	TfieldVar: Variant record for specifying and accessing a field dynamically (used in GetEntry)

---

**🔢 Global Variables**

**Lines 139–147:**

```
VAR
  nilField: TfieldVar;
  bootVol: TentryHdl;
  ...
```

Tracks:

•	Default field for GetEntry

•	Handles to boot device, twiggy drives (upper/lower), hardware ID

•	Entry list heads for doc, tool, vol, dev

---

**⚙️ EXTERNAL PROCEDURES**

---

**🔧 CreateEntry**

> Lines 150–176
> 

Creates a new entry of a given Tentry type (doc, tool, vol, dev) and initializes it from template records (blankDoc, etc.).

**Behavior:**

•	Allocates memory from heap

•	Inserts into appropriate list (firstDoc, etc.)

•	For vol, sets volHdl to self

**Error Handling:**

•	Fails silently with entryHdl := NIL

---

**📥 GetEntry**

> Lines 178–227
> 

Fetches the next matching entry in the list, optionally filtered by:

•	Volume

•	Field match (TfieldVar)

**Internal Helper:**

•	NextOnVol: Filters by volume association

---

**🧰 InitFEntry**

> Lines 229–361
> 

Initializes:

•	Global variables

•	Entry lists

•	Blank templates

•	Device discovery via GetNxtConfig and Cards_Equipped

**Hardware Logic:**

•	Classifies devices by slot/channel

•	Sets device icons (devKind)

•	Names devices using alerts

**➤ Identifies:**

•	bootVol, uTwigHdl, lTwigHdl

---

**❌ KillEntry**

> Lines 363–403
> 

Deletes an entry:

•	Searches list

•	Removes from list and frees memory

•	Clears associations (e.g., between vol and dev)

---

**🖨️ PrintEntry**

> Lines 405–475
> 

Debug-only (compiled with FlrDebug) printer for all entry types:

•	Formats and displays linked list content

•	Supports full-table or single-entry output

---

**🪟 WindowToDocEntry**

> Lines 477–486
> 

Utility to map a WindowPtr to the associated doc entry by comparing the fWindow field via GetEntry.

---

**🧵 IMPLEMENTATION FLAGS**

> Lines 488–492
> 

```
END.
```

Unit terminator.
