{apdm/desk3.text 5-Dec-83} { Copyright 1983, Apple Computer Co.}

{This file contains the procedures used to set up, display and monitor a dialog box.
 It is called exclusively by the routines in apdm/desk4.
                                                 - Ken Krugler}

{The data structures used by these routines are declared at the end of the standard type
 declarations in apdm/desk.}
```

**â†’ Analysis**

These comments establish the moduleâ€™s **exclusive integration** with desk4. This isolates UI setup from high-level control logic, promoting maintainability.

**ðŸ”¹ SYSTEM OVERVIEW COMMENT BLOCK**

```
{The following routines all draw the appropriate object from the info in PanelRec.
 The correct way to use these routines is to set the QD bottleneck procs to nil,
 start up picture recording, draw every panel (with DrawPanel, which will call one
 of these routines), close the picture and call UseDiBox.  UseDiBox will then handle
 events like keydown, mouseDown, etc., changing the panel states accordingly.  Any
 panel which has its state (visible/invisible) changed has its changed flag set to true.
 UseDiBox will then call ShowDiBox, which first sets the QD procs to be its own special
 procs, then replays the dialog picture.  If the panel being drawn by the replaced QD
 proc has changed, it is drawn and its changed flag is reset, otherwise the next panel
 is processed.  We know which panel corresponds to what QD proc call as the panels were
 all originally drawn in a linear order, which will match the ordering of the QD calls}
```

**â†’ Analysis**

Outlines the **dialog lifecycle**:

â€¢	Panels are drawn and recorded as a QuickDraw picture.

â€¢	During replay, only changed panels are redrawn.

â€¢	Use of custom bottleneck procs allows **dialog-specific overrides**.

â€¢	Clears, clips, and redraws the rectangular boundary

---

**PROCEDURE ClipDiName**

```
{clips the name to length maxSize.  If greater, chops name to maxSize-3 and adds three '.'}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Ensures long file names fit inside constrained UI boxes

---

**PROCEDURE CloseDiBox**

```
{make the linked list of panels a circular one, draw all of the panels to set up the picture,
 then show the dialog window on the screen for the first time and reset the menu bar.}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Shows dialog using DialogHeight, unhighlights menus with HiLiteMenu(0)

---

**PROCEDURE DiCommandKey**

 'Cant do cut/paste/copy with passwords...', then ignore it}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Prevents inappropriate command key usage in password fields

â€¢	Triggers StopAlert with specific error codes

```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	A classic Pascal memory management guard: frees only if Handle is non-nil

---

â€¢	DiNormal, DiUpdate, DiErase

â€¢	Sets changed := FALSE based on visibility

```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Invokes button procedure if a diButton was selected

â€¢	Submits password if needed

---

**PROCEDURE DoDiFinished**

```
{terminates the dialog box, calls the terminating procedure}
{reQueue = TRUE => shouldn't have done GetEvent, so re-queue for the filer}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Ends the dialog loop

â€¢	Optionally requeues event to the file manager

---

**PROCEDURE DoDiUpdate**

```
{handles a folder update sent to the dialog folder}
```

**Behavior:**

**PROCEDURES DrawDi<Button,Label,Line,Rect>**

```
{ Draw a dialog box label into the dialog box picture }
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Renders specific UI elements based on PanelRec

â€¢	Uses text metrics from FontInfo

â€¢	Applies padding, frames, and vertical alignment

---

**PROCEDURE DrawPanel**

```
{stuffs the picture being formed with a left paren, the QD commands to draw the panel, and a right
 paren.  Point of order, the QDHandle of the left paren points to a copy of what handleHdl points
 to.  This value is the actual handle to the designated panel -- all this because PicComment mades
 a copy of the data structure that you pass it a handle to.}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Encloses panel drawing in PicComment calls

â€¢	Allows replay of individual panels during ShowDiBox

---

**PROCEDURE InitDiBox**

```
{Set up the variables used for building a dialog box.
 (Note: First panel reference number is set to 1)}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Initializes the diBox master record

â€¢	Creates the first panel

â€¢	Sets outline, height, and picture handles

 Also bumps the reference number by one.}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Allocates and zero-initializes a PanelHandle

â€¢	Prepares bounding region and marks changed := TRUE

```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Disposes of panel memory (field text, buttons, labels)

â€¢	Deallocates all QD regions

â€¢	Fonts

â€¢	Styles

â€¢	Rectangles

â€¢	Text handles

â€¢	Visibility

â€¢	Creates bounding regions for hit testing

---

**PROCEDURE SetNullProcs**

```
{Sets all of the quickdraw bottleneck procedures that draw dialog box
 panels to be Nil (dialogFolder is thePort)}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Assigns all QDProcs to nil stubs to prevent drawing during testing

---

**PROCEDURE ShowDiBox**

```
{Display the dialog box.  Use the linked panel list from diBox}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Assigns custom QDProcs

â€¢	Replays the stored QuickDraw picture to draw the full dialog state

---

**PROCEDURE StartDiPic, StopDiPic**

```
{ start recording all QD calls }
{ stop recording QD calls }
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Start/stop QuickDraw picture recording of the dialog panels

---

**PROCEDURE TestDiBox, TestDiPanel**

```
{draws picture, only non-nil bottleneck routine is TestDiPanel.  TestDiPanel sets hitDiPanel non-nil
 of button up occured in a valid selectable panel (button/field).  TestDiPanel also inverts the
 current panel (PtInRgn check)}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Performs hit-testing

â€¢	Highlights selected panels

â€¢	Used to detect button clicks during dialog interaction

---

**PROCEDURE UseDiBox**

```
{main processing loop, co-exists uncomfortably with the main filer loop.  Basically calls ProcessTheEvent,
 which then calls the appropriate sub-event (ie. DoBtnDownEvent).  At the lower level routine is where
 the branch to either main filer code or dialog box code occurs}
```

**Behavior:**

â€¢	Main loop of the dialog system

â€¢	Intercepts events and routes them to dialog handlers

â€¢	Allows idle time for caret blinking, etc.

---

**âœ… CONCLUSION**

This file delivers a sophisticated event-driven dialog manager built atop **QuickDraw picture recording**, QDProcs interception, and low-level memory management via handles.

The **developer comments are an extraordinary primary source**, detailing:

â€¢	System design strategy

â€¢	Historical constraints (heap crashes, field bugs)

â€¢	Evolution over time (12/83â€“3/84)
